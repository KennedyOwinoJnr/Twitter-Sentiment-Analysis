### **Leveraging Sentiment Analysis for Enhanced Brand Management**

# **Business Understanding**
Twitter serves as a platform where users frequently express their opinions and experiences regarding various products. Analyzing these sentiments can yield valuable insights into consumer preferences and perceptions. Understanding public sentiment towards a brand is pivotal as positive sentiment often correlates with a strong brand image, while negative sentiment may indicate areas requiring attention.

In investment management and trading, comprehensive analysis is essential for making informed decisions. Alongside financial metrics and technical analysis, gauging public sentiment towards specific stocks provides a unique perspective. Positive public perception can bolster investor confidence, leading to increased demand for stocks and potentially better market performance.

# **Problem Statement**
Investment management and trading in the stock market present challenges due to market volatility and unpredictable events. Incorporating sentiment analysis from social media can provide valuable insights into public perception and sentiment towards specific stocks, thereby enhancing traditional analysis methods. In the rapidly evolving technology market, understanding customer sentiment towards products is crucial. However, manual sentiment analysis is time-consuming and prone to bias. Automating sentiment analysis using Machine Learning offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution.

# **Key Objectives**
Utilize Natural Language Processing techniques to construct a machine learning model for automated sentiment analysis of tweets related to Google and Apple products.
Collect and analyze sentiment data from Twitter regarding Apple and Google stocks.
Augment traditional financial analysis with sentiment analysis to identify potential investment opportunities or risks.
Use sentiment analysis to inform investment decisions, providing an alternative perspective on which stocks to invest in based on social sentiment.

# **Data Source**
The dataset, sourced from CrowdFlower via data.world, comprises over 9,000 tweets with sentiment ratings labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. The tweets were collected during the South by Southwest conference, primarily discussing Google and Apple products.

# **Data Description**
The dataset contains three columns:

tweet_text: Contains the text of the tweet, facilitating sentiment analysis based on the content itself.

product: Indicates whether the expressed emotion pertains to a specific brand or product.

sentiment: Serves as a quick indicator of brand-related sentiment, allowing for efficient initial filtering of relevant data.

# **Data Preparation**

**1.Data Cleaning**
Removal of placeholders, Twitter handles, stopwords, punctuation, and mentions of the SXSW conference.
Websites and HTML formatting removal.
Exclusion of "SXSW" mentions.

**2.Data Distribution**
Handling missing data by creating a new product category called "undefined."
Adding a new column "Brand" to indicate the brand the tweet is about.

**3.Data Preprocessing**
Lowercasing, tokenization, and lemmatization of text data.

# **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
The EDA focused on gaining insights into customer sentiments towards Google and Apple products. Key findings include the majority of tweets expressing neutral sentiment and the necessity for data cleaning due to missing values.

# **Modeling**
1.Baseline Model
XGBoost classifier with default parameters chosen as the baseline model.
Demonstrated superior performance on the training set compared to a naive model.

2.First Iteration: Complement Naive Bayes Model
Tuned complement-based Naive Bayes model observed to have an improved recall score of 71%.

# **Deep Learning**
Utilization of advanced neural network architectures to extract actionable insights from social media data.

In our project, false positives occur when the sentiment analysis model incorrectly predicts positive sentiment in tweets that do not express it, potentially leading to overestimation of brand positivity and misguided investment decisions. Conversely, false negatives happen when the model fails to identify positive sentiment in tweets that do express it, potentially resulting in missed investment opportunities or undervaluation of stocks. False negatives are deemed more detrimental than false positives. The best model achieved a recall of 71% and an accuracy score of 72%, indicating its ability to identify positive sentiments in the dataset accurately.

# **Conclusion**
Deep Learning model identified as the best-performing model.

Benefits include competitive advantage and real-time analysis.

Limitations include data intensity and computational resource requirements.
